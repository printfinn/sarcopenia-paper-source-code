The published paper: http://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00123

# See Part 5 ~ Part 8 for the result of leave-one-out and k-fold cross validation.

The set up in these files are not exactly the same as we presented in our paper, we are using 9 features here. but we shall get the same result if we change the set up to follow that we use in our paper for leave-one-out cross validation.

The patient data we are using are not stored on the web, because there is patient privacy we don't want to expose. Reviewers / researchers of the paper can request from us through editor / email, and we can give them the data with personal information left out, so reviewers / researchers could go on testing / experimenting the result of our research with the source code in this repository.
